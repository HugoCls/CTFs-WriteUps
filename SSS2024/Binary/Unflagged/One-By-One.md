## Analysis

Using strings function on the file, we find this sequence: `dSoo{}o_lft_pk_chchbSi_laeS_GCC:`.

I first thought it was a vigenere ciphered sequence but I can't find a proper decryption for it.

To get SSS from dSo it would have needed LAW as a key it would have done the following sequence `sSsd{}o_put_tz_clrhfHi_ppeW_VCG`
